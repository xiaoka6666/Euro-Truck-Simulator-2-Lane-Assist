### ETS2LA C# 3.0.12
* Implemented `ETS2LA.AR` using `ImGui` internally and rendering using `GLSL` via `OpenGL`.
* The AR overlay for C# is much improved over python, once you update you'll see the many changes.
* Styling is not done yet, the current version is very much "programmer art". All functionality should be implemented.
